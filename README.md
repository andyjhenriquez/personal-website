# Andy's Minimal Portfolio (React + Vite + Tailwind + Framer Motion)

## Quickstart
```bash
npm install
npm run dev
```

## Build
```bash
npm run build
npm run preview
```

## Customize
- Replace **/src/assets/face.png** with your photo.
- Edit project cards in **/src/components/Projects.jsx**.
- Update contact details in **/src/components/Contact.jsx**.
- Accent color: tweak `--accent` in **/src/index.css**.
- Add more sections as needed.

## Notes
- The contact form is static. Hook it to a backend (e.g., serverless function, Resend/SendGrid) to send emails.
- Tailwind is pre-configured via PostCSS.
- Animations powered by Framer Motion.
