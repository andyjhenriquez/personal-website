       with the help of the Unviersal Creative team at the UCF Universal Creative Lab. Visualized and showcased with the Meta Quest 2 using the Unity Engine by creating a spline based tool for controlling the ride vehicle.

      deck to the base, and sticking a VIVE tracker on top the deck. The VIVE tracker was being tracked by 2 VIVE Base Stations which would be sending the rotational and positional vectors of the
      board to the Unity app.`,
